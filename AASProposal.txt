Background
- Diversity crisis and the role that phylogenetics plays in it
- Sky Islands and their unique environments
- Aphonopelma genus as a study system for the sky island diversity
	Mention the new species being discovered at higher elevations
	maxent progam showing the potential habitats at LGM and most recent
	next generation sequencng methods making it easier to flesh out new data and create better more informative trees
- Research extended to Mexico where there have been specimens found
- Estimates of how many new species we could find!
Materials and Methods

Significance
- Species of conservation concern
- insight into phylogenetics and evolutionary history of the Aphonopelma species of the Madrean Sky Islands 
- Future population genetics research on tarantulas of the americas
- Insight into biogeographic information and how species diversify in sky islands
- Additionally, this research will inform
- Taxonomy in a difficult group with high potential for species discovery.
- Recruitment of undergraduates to help with field and molecular work
- Mentoring of students inetersted in STEM
Budget
- Funding from this grant will primarily go towards field work in the collection of more specimens from areas not looked at before
